The goal of dspacer is to support access to the [DSpace REST API](https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/releases/tag/dspace-8.0).

## Installation

You can install the development version of dspacer like so:

``` r
pak::pkg_install("elipousson/dspacer")
```

## Example

```{r}
library(dspacer)
```

These are basic examples of three public end points that do not require authentication:

```{r}
ds_collections(
  "https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/server/api"
)

ds_search(
  "https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/server/api"
)

ds_communities(
  "https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/server/api"
)
```
The [DSpace 7 REST Contract repository](https://github.com/DSpace/RestContract) documents new DSpace REST API Contract beginning with version 7.0.
